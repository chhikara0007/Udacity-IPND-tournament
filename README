## UDACITY - IPND - FINAL PROJECT

Intro to Programming Back-End Developer - Tournament Project

## Project Description: 

The tournament project is designed to implement a Python module that uses a PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. The tournament is uses a Swiss pairing system to match players in each round.

The goal of the Swiss pairings system is to pair each player with an opponent who has won the same number of matches, or as close as possible.

This project assumes that the number of players in a tournament is an even number. 

The code and database in this project are designed to support a single tournament at a time. 

All players who are in the database participate in the tournament, and since it uses a Swiss pairing system, no player is left out of a round. 

Each time a new tournament is run, all the game records from the previous tournament are deleted.
